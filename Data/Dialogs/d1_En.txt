Greetings, mortal!
Although, considering your current state...
not the point.
You were resurrected for a single purpose.
To test this dungeon
before the adventurers enter here.
Explore, test traps...
ON YOURSELF.. AHAHAH!!!
I turned off the monsters to save resources
and time
...
If you want to leave...
then know ...
I don't give you the right to choose,
you're locked in here.
Don't even try.
The exit is closed.
So...
go ahead, meet the adventures!
...
oh, yes, I almost forgot.
You can always come back here.
If there are any problems,
If you get lost, you'll get lost,
And give up!
Just praise (press) “H"!
I'm also waiting for you if you have any questions
I'll try to tell you what you need
And where to go...
and now...
ON HORSEBACK!
;
As I understand it, you don't know what to do.
Okay...
so be it, I'll tell you.
You have to go through this floor
and go down to the next one!
The transition to the next floor is activated
by the energy of the laser, which is now turned off
It is necessary to power it from...
a nuclear reactor..
YES, there is a nuclear reactor in the dungeon
NOTHING ordinary.
You can
take the uranium rods from the refrigerator.
From the exit to the right.
Or to the left…
It depends on which side to look at.
And now go ahead! (Explore the map)
;
Thanks for testing the refrigerator.
You would have stood there forever
Well done for thinking of coming back here before he died.
The teleporter takes apart your former
self and gathers you here.
If you lose limbs or die
, your last
healthy state will be loaded.
Damn skeleton, it was necessary to raise zombies.
Can't take a uranium rod without freezing.
Okay... There is one way.
You should get
an artifact against the cold.
You can find him in room 48.
;
You what! Is it something at all? 
Uranium is radioactive!
And...
and ........
And you're an undead, clearly, clearly.
Okay, the adventurers will be alive.
Until some point.
Now take the uranium to the reactor
and put it in the cells.
This should power the beam.
;
Eh... you need to be taught everything!
Go to the lower floor and solve
the puzzle with mirrors there.
Spin them…
Maybe that will work out.
You can touch the ray, I don't think
That he would hurt you.

Can't you solve
the pentagram puzzle?
Listen, I don't know
how to solve it myself.
It's all the damn automators!
Ponapridumyvayut all sorts of things ...
And then I explain to the testers,
How to work with it.
;
I told you,
go to the refrigerator.
From the exit to the right.
;
Artifact in Room 48
There's a puzzle,
you need to collect the symbol
of the supreme creator.
;
Reactor – the first door
to the left of the exit.
;
Mirrors on the lower floor.
How will you get out of here, 
you'll see the stairs.
Go down it.
;
Look at the condition
under which the torches
are lit and find a pattern.
;
How does a laser
powered by a nuclear reactor taste to you
ahahahah
BUT it's good that there's a copy of you.
It's possible to restore you
even from nothing
or make a clone...
that's how I make monsters
for my dungeon.
Keep turning the lasers,
to get to the next level.
;
You have an artifact
, go to the refrigerator
for uranium
